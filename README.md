# About
This is a custom fetch created by me in bash. It originally worked on bash only but I made it work on other shells. This fetching script stands out due to it being extremely lightweight and minimalist, say goodbye to useless bloat.
## Features

- Extremely low linecount (20 lines)
  - Older versions were even more lightweight, so if you wanna sacrifice extra features for less lines, feel free to do so.
- Extremely lightweight
- Gets the job done
- Looks nice enough
