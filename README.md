# weirdfetch
This is a custom fetch created by me in bash. It originally worked on bash only but I made it work on other shells. I don't know why you would want to use this over other fetches aside from it being lightweight, but it exists. It only officially works on Linux, but BSD should work too.

## Features

- Extremely low linecount (20 lines)
- Extremely lightweight
- Gets the job done
- Looks nice enough
